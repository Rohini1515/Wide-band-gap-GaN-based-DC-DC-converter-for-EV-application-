# Wide-band-gap-GaN-based-DC-DC-converter-for-EV-application-
This project presents a wide-bandgap GaN-based LLC DC-DC converter for EV applications. GaN switches enable high-frequency operation, reduced switching loss, and higher efficiency than Si MOSFETs. The LLC tank provides soft switching and stable voltage conversion, making the system compact, efficient, and ideal for EV power stages.
